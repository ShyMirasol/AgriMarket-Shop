        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to AgriMarket Shop, a digital hub created especially for farmers, gardeners, and agriculture enthusiasts. 
          We believe that access to the right seeds, tools, and reliable suppliers should be simple, transparent, and community-driven.</p>
        <p>
          In many farming communities, finding trustworthy sellers can be challenging. Prices vary, product quality is uncertain, and information is often incomplete. 
          That’s why we built AgriMarket Shop — not as a traditional online store, but as a bridge between sellers and growers. </p>
       <p>
        Here, you can:
           </p>

      <p>
          🌾 Discover a wide range of seeds and tools, carefully listed with details to guide your choices.
          📖 Learn more about each product with clear descriptions, planting tips, and practical uses.
          🤝 Connect directly with trusted sellers to ask questions, negotiate, and build long-term partnerships.
          We don’t take a percentage or act as a middleman. Instead, we give you the power to decide by putting reliable information and direct seller contact at your fingertips.
      </p>
      <p>Our mission is simple: help farmers and gardeners grow more, grow better, and grow together. 🌍💚</p>
